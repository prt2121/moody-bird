moody-bird
==========

## Flappy Bird clone for Google Glass.

This is a result of I fooled around with [GDK](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/), [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [LibGDX library](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

### Glassware Description
Moody Bird is a side-scrolling game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective is to direct a flying bird between each oncoming set of pipes without colliding with them. The user has to jump/squat/stand up to make the bird fly and he/she can also get extra scores by tapping the touchpad to drop bird's poop to kill a boar.
